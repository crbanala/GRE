# GRE
I am adding all the resources, I wish somebody had told me before, for preparation of verbal. 
This is going to be "exclusively" for verbal section.
Will probably add my experience on the test day if I have time.

Vocab :
Priority1 : https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/gre-vocabulary-list-words/

Priority2 : magoosh flash cards common and then basic (no need for advanced. go for it only if you have time.)

Priority 3: Barrons 333 (you would have known all these by now)

Priority 4(No need at all): Barrons 1100
